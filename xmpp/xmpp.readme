Xmpp tunneling of mqtt messages is used in case wired internet is not available. The xmpp server must support either bosch or websockets. 
Tested locally with prosody and remotely with jabber.hot-chilli.net. Attention: service at jabber.hot-chilli.net stopped after some time probably due to limit in daily traffic per account. 

Important Note: Use pidgin or other xmpp client to authorize each other xmpp account or else connection will fail. 

Important Note: Use chrome plugin to allow CORS or else connection will fail (unfortunately no such plugin seems to be availble for android chrome).

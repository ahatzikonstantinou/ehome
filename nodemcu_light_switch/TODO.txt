According to https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/1017#issuecomment-156689684
if the wdt reset is triggert the board reboots, when it reboots it is checking the state of GPIO0 and GPIO15 and GPIO2
GPIO15 	GPIO0 	GPIO2 	Mode
0V 	0V 	3.3V 	Uart Bootloader
0V 	3.3V 	3.3V 	Boot sketch
consider setting GPIO15 to 0V, GPIO0 to 3.3V and GPIO2 to 3.3V in order to ensure that after a crash nodemcu will reboot the sketch
